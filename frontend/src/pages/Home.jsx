          Mindful Motion is a platform to maximize teenagersâ€™ productivity and
          ultimately boost their ambition by creating a web app that allows for
          users to continue to get their dopamine rush obtained from scrolling
          on an app, but control the content being fed to them by only hosting
          projects and challenges to our users.

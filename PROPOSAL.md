## The Problem

Many people use their time unproductively, spending countless hours scrolling through social media posts. Excessive social media usage has become a serious problem for not only adults but especially teenagers. Growing up with greater exposure to the internet than prior generations, teenagers spend much of their time online. Our group intended to offer an opportunity to learn new skills, compete with each other in creative challenges, and ultimately boost users' productivity.

- Needs of Focus:
  - Lack of productivity in free time
  - Dopamine-induced appeal of social media
  - Inclusivity of diverse interests and communication


## Summary

<!-- content goes below -->

We will provide a platform for users to interact in communities based on their interests and to share projects and interactive challenges. Our target audience is people who seek greater involvement in activities, particularly teenagers who are struggling with the effects of doom scrolling. We hope our solution will encourage users to be more proactive and ambitious overall. Through seeing others‚Äô involvement, users will gain interest in engaging with project-based challenges.


## Our Hypothesis

TACI‚Äôs hypothesis: if teenagers are exposed to more productive content, then it will have a direct impact on the teenagers‚Äô productivity and ambition. For starters, one of our team members, Tyron, noticed this with his younger sisters at home. Tyron‚Äôs sisters are regularly active users of TikTok. When they stumbled on a do-it-yourself churro recipe, it took them off their devices, encouraging them to make pastries for hours. This shows how ‚Äòproductive scrolling‚Äô can allow for people to be more active. Also, in "Doomscrolling and Brain Rot", Ebersole states ‚ÄúDoomscrolling often involves skimming surface-level information, which can erode teenagers' capacity for deep thinking and critical analysis‚Äù. More examples can be seen in "The Doomscrolling Pandemic" by Woolf, who says, ‚ÄúA 2023 study found that 62% of workers reported that doomscrolling hinders their ability to focus on tasks, and over 70% admitted to missing deadlines or underperforming due to doomscrolling‚Äù. Time on social media does not have to be so destructive, especially when engaging users in project-based challenges and activities to boost their productivity and ambition.

## üèãüèΩ Extension Opportunities

We wonder whether time of release will impact the effectiveness of our application. We are interested in showcasing challenge participation in user profiles.

Partnerships with schools could strengthen this project since schools tend to center around guiding youth through activities fostering growth. Our solution can decrease the effects of doom scrolling through encouraging people to immerse themselves in creative activities.
